PAINTING
---
1:

For painting and visual representation we will need to add a SCALER.
This SCALER scales the relative sizes of every object to be painted
by its size. This is to ease up the coding of the program's logic when
it comes to locations on screen, but e.g. size 1 would mean that the
object would take up 1 pixel on the screen so it needs to be scaled up.

Alternative solution may be used. 

2:

Actors and Tiles need a visual representation. Sprite or a PNG?
Or a Square in the meantime?
Also, Tiles need to be bigger than the actors in them / The visuals
have to be painted top to bottom.

INTERACT METHOD
---

Player can interact with dead actors / treasure actor. 
This happens because the program checks for the HP of the actor
and if HP <= 0 than the player interacts instead of attacks.  

---

INVENTORY
--- 

Painting Inventory may be cumbersome due to the possibility of infinite
inventory. Implement a max inventory size / ability to scroll the inventory.
(IDK how swing works)

give() methods inside of treasure might be moved Actor class as Monsters will also 
likely have a similar set of methods.
